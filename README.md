# Sequential-Pattern-Mining

This Project mainly focuses on solving the problem of suggesting the doctor the next best procedure that the patient should undergo without being dependent on the previous report and this also saves time of the medical staff and also the cost of patient ignoring the unnecessary procedures. This helps in preventing fraud done in some of the private hospitals in the country

This project is done by using Mathematical and Machine Learning Concepts such as <br>
<h3>1.Sequential Pattern Mining.
<h3>2.Sequential Rule Mining.
<h3>3.Association Rule Mining.
