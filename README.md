# Sequential-Pattern-Mining

This Project mainly focuses on solving the problem of suggesting the doctor the next best procedure that the patient should undergo without being dependent on the previous report and this also saves time of the medical staff and also the cost of patient ignoring the unnecessary procedures. This helps in preventing frauds done in some of the private hospitals in the country

This project is done by using Mathematical and Machine Learning Concepts such as <br>
<h3>1.Sequential Pattern Mining.
<h3>2.Sequential Rule Mining.
<h3>3.Association Rule Mining.
  
For complete explanation of this project I have created one presentaion file and which is uploaded in this repository
This will give a complete workflow and the tools and technologies used for completion of this project

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<b>1.This project mainly saves time of Doctor,medical staff and also the patient<br>
<b>2.This also helps in saving the cost of the patient<br>
<b>3.This also suggests the best set of procedures to be undergone by the patient in an efficient manner
